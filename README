qemu with CTR support
==============
3DS's ARM9 processor emulation with qemu.
Implemented devices :
 - sdmmc (not tested with actual firm, works with Normmatt's sdmmc.c)
 - lcd
 - aes (passthrough, data will not be encrypted or decrypted)
 - sha
 - timers
 - interrupt controller (only timers are wired to this for now)

Howto
==============
Build:
```
./configure --disable-user --target-list=arm-softmmu
make
```
to compile with just arm support. SDL library required for LCD support, gnutls required for crypto support.

To run a payload:
```
arm-softmmu/qemu-system-arm -kernel "path/to/payload.elf" -M ctr9
```

Debugging:
```
arm-softmmu/qemu-system-arm -S -gdb tcp:127.0.0.1:1234,ipv4 -kernel "path/to/payload.elf" -M ctr9
```

Optional support files:
 - 3ds-data/sd.bin - will be used as the fat16 image for the sdcard
 - 3ds-data/nand.bin - will be used as the fat16 image for the nand
 - 3ds-data/sdmmc_info.bin - contains the csd and cid for the nand and sdcard
 - 3ds-data/qemu_ctr_bootrom9.bin - file loaded to bootrom (for the interrupt redirection)
